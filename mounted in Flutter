What Is mounted in Flutter?
mounted is a boolean property available inside a State class.
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
}
Internally:
bool get mounted;
It tells you:
Whether this State object is currently attached to the widget tree.

====================================

When Is mounted True?
After initState
While widget is visible in UI
Before dispose
When Does It Become False?
After:
@override
void dispose() {
  super.dispose();
}
Once disposed → mounted = false
The widget is no longer in the widget tree.

======================================

Why Is It Important?
Because async operations may complete after the widget is removed.
Example:
void loadData() async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
  setState(() {
    data = "Loaded";
  });
}
If user navigates away before 3 seconds:
Widget is disposed
setState() runs on a dead widget
App crashes

=======================================

Common Situations Where mounted Is Required
API calls
Delayed operations
Navigation after await
Showing dialogs/snackbars after async
Animation callbacks
Timers
Example:
await apiCall();

if (!mounted) return;

Navigator.push(context, ...);

==========================================

What Problem Does It Actually Solve?
It prevents:
Updating UI after the widget is removed.
Which protects against:
Memory leaks
Unexpected crashes
Invalid context usage
