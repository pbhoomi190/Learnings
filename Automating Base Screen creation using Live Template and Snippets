# BaseScreen Boilerplate Reduction Guide

## Why this document exists

In our project, most screens are built on a custom `BaseScreen` + `BaseScreenState` pattern. This gives consistency (lifecycle, app bar behavior, shared structure), but it also means each new screen usually needs more boilerplate than a standard Flutter `stl`/`stf` widget.

Without automation, developers repeatedly write:
- Screen class extending `BaseScreen`
- State class extending `BaseScreenState<ScreenName>`
- Common overrides (for example `showAppBar`, `isBackButtonEnabled`)
- `body(BuildContext buildContext)` implementation scaffold

This is repetitive and error-prone (wrong generic type, missed override, missing imports).

## Recommended approach

Use editor automation:
- VS Code snippets (workspace-level)
- Android Studio Live Templates

This keeps logic consistent and significantly reduces manual typing when creating new screens.

## What gets better with snippets/templates

- Faster screen creation (seconds instead of minutes)
- Fewer copy/paste errors
- Consistent class/state naming patterns
- Consistent default overrides across modules
- Easier onboarding for new developers

## VS Code setup

### 1) Create workspace snippet file

Create file:
- `.vscode/dart.code-snippets`

### 2) Add snippet entries

Use prefixes such as:
- `bss` for full `BaseScreen + BaseScreenState`
- `bstate` for state-only block

### 3) Ensure suggestions are enabled

In `.vscode/settings.json`, ensure snippet settings are enabled (Tab completion, snippet suggestions visible).

### 4) Usage

- Open any `.dart` file
- Type `bss` or `bstate`
- Press `Tab`

If needed:
- Use `Ctrl+Space` to open suggestions and select the snippet
- Run **Developer: Reload Window** once after first setup

## Android Studio setup (Live Templates)

### 1) Open Live Templates

- `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `Live Templates`
- Select `Dart` group (or create one)

### 2) Create template

- Add a new Live Template
- Abbreviation: `bss` (or `bstate`)
- Description: for example "BaseScreen template"

### 3) Set template context (required)

Set context to:
- **Dart: top-level**

You may also enable `Dart: declaration`, but **Dart: top-level** must be included for screen class generation.

### 4) Configure expand shortcut

- Set expand by `Tab` (or use `Ctrl+J` to manually insert)

### 5) Usage

- Open a Dart file
- Put cursor at top-level scope
- Type abbreviation (`bss`/`bstate`)
- Press `Tab` (or `Ctrl+J`)

## Troubleshooting checklist

### VS Code

- Snippet file is valid JSON and in `.vscode/dart.code-snippets`
- File language mode is Dart
- Snippet suggestions are enabled
- Reload window after adding snippets

### Android Studio

- Context includes **Dart: top-level**
- Abbreviation has no spaces
- Cursor is in top-level scope (not inside a method)
- `Expand Live Template by Tab` key binding is active
- `Ctrl+J` shows your template in the list

## Team recommendation

Treat `bss` / `bstate` as project-standard shortcuts for new screen creation. This keeps code style and inheritance pattern aligned with the custom base screen architecture while reducing repetitive manual work.
